# Analysis-Testing-Amazon-Web-Store



This repository outlines the software testing strategy for our project, ensuring the quality and reliability of the application across various dimensions such as functionality, usability, performance, security, and more.

## Testing Categories

1. **Functional Testing** emphasises on ensuring that the application performs as intended when it comes to its core features, which include user authentication, navigation, and interaction with key components.

2. **Usability Testing** Assesses the application's user experience (UX) components to make sure end users can easily use, understand, and access it.

3. **Examen Evaluation**  
   checks the application's stability and responsiveness under different load scenarios, as well as its speed and resource utilisation.

4. **Testing for Security**  
   makes ensuring the program is safe by concentrating on finding weak points, dangers, and possible ways to attack it.

5. **Testing for Compatibility**  
   Checks if the program works with various platforms, operating systems, browsers, and devices.

6. **Regression Testing** Verifies that fresh modifications to the codebase don't interfere with already-existing features.

7. **Testing for accessibility**  
   makes sure the program can be used by users of different skill levels, with an emphasis on adhering to accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.0.

## Example of a Test Case Structure

Every test case adheres to a predetermined format that comprises:

- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
- **Description**: A brief description of what is being tested.
- **Expected Result**: The desired outcome of the test.
- **Actual Result**: The observed outcome when the test is executed.
- **Pass/Fail**: Indicates whether the test passed or failed.
- **Comments**: Additional notes or remarks about the test case.

Example of a Functional Test:

| Test Case ID | Description                 | Expected Result                            | Actual Result                            | Pass/Fail | Comments           |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| FT001        | Test login with valid credentials | Login successful, redirects to homepage     | Login successful, redirects to homepage   | Pass      | As expected        |
| FT002        | Test login with invalid password | Error message "Incorrect password" displayed | Error message "Incorrect password" displayed | Pass      | Error correctly handled |

## Tools and Frameworks

The testing process involves the following tools and frameworks:

- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing for JavaScript.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing.
- **Selenium**: UI automation for browser testing.
- **JMeter**: Load testing for performance.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security vulnerability scanning.
- **BrowserStack**: Cross-browser compatibility testing.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run functional and regression tests
npm run test:functional

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run security tests
npm run test:security
```

## Reporting

All test results are logged and reported in structured formats. Summary reports can be generated in HTML, JSON, or CSV formats, allowing team members to review test outcomes efficiently.
